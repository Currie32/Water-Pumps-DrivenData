# Water-Pumps-DrivenData
My submission for the "Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table" hosted by DrivenData.

Have a look at either of my files to inspect my analysis. I recommend looking at the Rmd file because there is some code that is only visible on that file and not the HTML file. However, you will need a program, such as RStudio to be able to read that file.
